# Go Virtual Terminal

Project was created to present basic application of connecting stripe with GO. In picture down below we can see the 4 input fields, last one is from stripe to enter your card number. I presented two scenarios with valid card number and invalid one. Last image occure when we submit form with valid card number, it will redirect us to payment details.
